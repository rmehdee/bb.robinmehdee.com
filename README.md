# Mini Basketball Game

A simple browser-based basketball shooting game. Built for fun and learning.

This repository contains a simple yet polished basketball shooting game built with React and Vite. The interface is styled to resemble shadcn/ui components, dark panels, clean buttons and subtle shadows, without bringing in any heavy dependencies.

To run the game locally you need Node.js installed. Clone this repository, install dependencies and start the development server:

git clone https://github.com/yourâ€‘username/basketball-mini-game.git

cd basketball-mini-game

npm install

npm run dev

Enjoy
